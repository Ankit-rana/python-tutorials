# Factory is a structural Python design pattern aimed at creating 
# new objects, hiding the instantiation logic from the user. But 
# creation of objects in Python is dynamic by design, so additions 
# like Factory are not necessary. Of course, you are free to implement 
# it if you want to. There might be cases where it would be really 
# useful, but theyâ€™re an exception, not the norm.
# we also use when we want to close classes for modification
